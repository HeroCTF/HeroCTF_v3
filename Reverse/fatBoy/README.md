### Write up

We can notive that this file is a universal mach-o, which means that it can be runned on multiple architectures.
The algorithm is a simple Vineg√®re cipher with a key unxored at the begining of the encryption function.
After solving the challenge in x86_64, we find the flag "Hero{IMSORRYBUTTHISISNOTTHEFLAG}" with the key "BESTRONG", and we have to reverse the ARM version to find the good flag which is "Hero{WTFISTHISFUCKINGFILEFORMAT}" with the key "FATMACHO".
