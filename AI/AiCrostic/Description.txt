There, have you ever coded an AI ?
Hey, after this challenge the answer to that question will be yes.
I advise you to get started there : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQdL_0jzt20Uwe-ytPjVIflfErZ-4jp5?usp=sharing
Second, go to File -> Save a Copy in Google drive (If you have a google account)
When done, you can then import files (like npy.zip for example ?) in the notebook's file section.
After that, it's up to you.
You will have to code out the flag. :wink:

Otherwise, you must have jupyter-notebook with the following :
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
