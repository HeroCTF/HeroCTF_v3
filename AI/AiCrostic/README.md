### Description

**T**here, have you ever coded an AI ?  
**H**ey, after this challenge the answer to that question will be yes.  
**I** advise you to get started [there](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQdL_0jzt20Uwe-ytPjVIflfErZ-4jp5?usp=sharing)  
**S**econd, go to File -> Save a Copy in Google drive (If you have a google account)  
**W**hen done, you can then import files in the notebook's file section.  
**A**fter that, it's up to you.  
**Y**ou will have to code out the flag. :wink:

Otherwise, you must have jupyter-notebook with the following :
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
