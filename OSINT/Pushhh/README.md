### Write up

The two repositories of the last edition are :

- https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v2
- https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v2_INFRA

`HeroCTF_v2` have a branch named `flag`. Let's switch to this [branch](https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v2/tree/flag).

Then a [flag.txt](https://github.com/HeroCTF/HeroCTF_v2/blob/flag/flag.txt) file appears. Read it and get the flag !
