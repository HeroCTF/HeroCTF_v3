RansomWTF

My neighbour is obsessed with eggs. So much that he doesn't have money left to buy some.
When he was having a drink home, I left him 2 minutes on my PC, and I found all my pictures had been ransomwared.
He's asking for 2M eggs by tomorrow, but I can't buy that much eggs. Even if I could, I'm not sure I would.
Fortunately, he left the script he used to encrypt my pictures.
I hope you'll be able to retrieve this picture..
